	abstract = {Objectives A primary methodological weakness of the single-case experimental design (SCED) outcome studies conducted of the treatment of personality disorder with cognitive analytic therapy (CAT) is that they have failed to employ a withdrawal phase or cross-over design and so are deemed quasi-experimental. This study sought to implement a withdrawal design, in order to improve the internal validity of the study to make it a true SCED, and also in order to enable the patient to explore abandonment dynamics. Design The study employed an A1/B1/A2/B2 with extended follow-up SCED with a female patient treated with CAT meeting diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Following the 6-week baseline period ‘A1’, treatment occurred in two phases (21 sessions ‘B1’ and 24 sessions ‘B2’) sandwiching a 12-week treatment withdrawal phase (‘A2’) and a 24-week structured follow-up phase. Seven idiographic daily measures were collected that created a N = 698 day timeline. Nomothetic outcome measures were collected at baseline and at the end of each phase of the study, and the Session Impact Scale was completed after each treatment session. Results There was a significant increase in the task focus of treatment sessions. Ideographically, CAT was an effective treatment for improving the participant’s self-to-self relationship, as their self-hate reduced and their sense-of-self increased. There was a broad pattern of deterioration during the second treatment phase (B2) and follow-up phase across the ideographic measures, and CAT was ineffective for BPD ideographic emotional or self-to-other measures. Reliable change occurred on the primary BPD nomothetic outcome measure from baseline to end of first treatment phase. Conclusions The study suggests that the CAT intervention was partially successful and that it is possible to integrate good research practice with clinical innovation. The methodological strengths and limitations of the design and the clinical implications of the results are discussed. Practitioner points Cognitive analytic therapy was partially effective in the treatment of BPD in a case that had been unresponsive to other psychological interventions. Therapists need to complete lengthy and structured follow-up to capture any emerging relapse. Therapists need to discuss the patient’s thoughts and feelings about termination regularly in a relationally informed manner.},

	abstract = {Background: Outcome studies of the treatment of compulsive buying disorder (CBD) have rarely compared the effectiveness of differing active treatments. Aims: This study sought to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and personcentred/experiential therapy (PCE) in a cross-over design. Method: An ABC single case experimental design with extended follow-up with a female patient meeting diagnostic criteria for CBD. Checks indicated that both CBT and PCE were competently delivered. Ideographic CBD outcomes were intensively measured over a continuous 350-day time series. Following a one-month baseline assessment phase (A; 28 days; 3 sessions), CBT was delivered via thirteen outpatient sessions (B:160 days) and then PCE was delivered via six outpatient sessions (C:63 days). There was a 99-day follow-up period. Results: Frequency and duration of compulsive buying episodes decreased during active treatment. CBT and PCE were both highly effective compared to baseline for reducing shopping obsessions, excitement about shopping, compulsion to shop and improving self-esteem. When the PCE and CBT treatment phases were compared against each other, few differences were apparent in terms of outcome. There was no evidence of any relapse over the follow-up period. A reliable and clinically significant change on the primary nomothetic measure (i.e., Compulsive Buying Scale) was retained over time. Conclusions: The study suggests that both CBT and PCE can be effective for CBD. Methodological limitations and suggestions for future CBD outcome research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Aims: The Unified Protocol (UP) is indicated when patients present with comorbidity, but no studies have investigated the effectiveness of the UP with comorbid health anxiety and depression. Method: An A/B single case design evaluated outcomes for a 27-year-old male presenting with health anxiety and comorbid depression. Following a 21-day assessmentbaseline period, the manualised UP was delivered across a 42-day period containing seven intervention sessions. Four idiographic measures (occurrence and duration of health checking, sleep duration and food intake satisfaction) were collected daily throughout and two nomothetic measures were collected at four time-points. Results: All sessions were attended. Number of health checking episodes reduced from four per day to two per day. A 59 minute per day reduction in time spent health checking occurred and sleep increased by 100-minutes per night. There was little apparent change in terms of food intake satisfaction. There was a reliable and clinically significant reduction in depression. Discussion: Further testing of the effectiveness of the UP with comorbid health anxiety and depression in a true single case experimental design is now indicated.},

	doi = {10.1017/S1352465821000114},
	abstract = {Background: This was a multi-site evaluation of psycho-educational transdiagnostic seminars (TDS) as a pre-treatment intervention to enhance the effectiveness and utilisation of high intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT).
Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of TDS combined with high intensity CBT (TDS+CBT) versus a matched sample receiving CBT only. Second, to determine the consistency of results across participating services which employed CBT+TDS. Finally, to determine the acceptability of TDS across patients with different psychological disorders.
Method: 106 patients across three services voluntarily attended TDS while on a waiting list for CBT (TDS+CBT). Individual and pooled service pre-post treatment effect-sizes were calculated using measures of depression, anxiety and functional impairment. Effectiveness and completion rates for TDS+CBT were compared to a propensity score matched sample from an archival dataset of cases who received high intensity CBT only.
Results: Pre-post treatment effect-sizes for TDS+CBT were comparable to the matched sample. Recovery rates were greater for the group receiving TDS however this was not statistically significant. Greater improvements were observed during the waiting-list period for patients who had received TDS for depression (d = 0.49 compared to d = 0.07) and anxiety (d = 0.36 compared to d = 0.04).
Conclusions: Overall, this new evidence found a trend for TDS improving symptoms while awaiting CBT across three separate IAPT services. The effectiveness of TDS now warrants further exploration through an appropriately sized randomised control trial.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The novel coronavirus and associated restrictions have resulted in mental health services across the UK having to adapt how they deliver psychological assessments and interventions. The purpose of this paper is to explore the accessibility and prospective acceptability of providing telephone and videoconference-mediated psychological interventions in individuals with intellectual disabilities.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              As part of a service evaluation, a mixed-methods questionnaire was developed and completed by clients who had been referred for psychological therapy at an adult intellectual disabilities’ community health service in the north of England. All clients were assessed using the Red/Amber/Green (RAG) system by a consultant clinical psychologist for risk and potential suitability for indirect service delivery given their ability and needs.
            
            
              Findings
              Overall, 22 clients were invited to take part, of which, only seven (32\%) were accepting of telephone or videoconference-mediated psychological therapy. Most of the clients were unable to engage in video-conference therapy and therefore, only suitable for phone therapy. This paper presents the remaining findings and discusses the clinical implications and unique considerations for intellectual disability services drawing on the existing literature.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This is the first paper that the authors are aware of, examining videoconference-mediated psychological therapy in this population. It is hoped the data will be used to help inform practice or policy when using such therapeutic approaches in adults with an intellectual disability.},
